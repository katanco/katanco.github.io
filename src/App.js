          Hi there! You might have seen Salem around the neighborhood. He's a
          very friendly black mixed-breed cat with medium-length fur and a
          distinctive scar on his nose. He loves exploring the outdoors, but he
          has a loving home and family waiting for him.
        </p>
        <h2>Important Information About Salem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>He's allowed to roam:</strong> Salem is an indoor/outdoor
            cat and enjoys exploring. Please don't be concerned if you see him
            out and about.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>He's very friendly!</strong> Salem loves attention and might
            approach you for a friendly hello. Feel free to say hi!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>He's up-to-date on his shots:</strong> Salem's vaccinations
            are current, so you don't need to worry about his health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Please do not feed or house him:</strong> Salem has a
            dedicated family who provides him with everything he needs. Extra
            food can actually be harmful to him, and we want to make sure he
            always comes home.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We appreciate your concern for Salem! He's a much-loved member of our
          family, and we're so grateful to live in a neighborhood where people
          care about animals. If you have any serious concerns about Salem's
          well-being, please don't hesitate to contact us at [Your Phone Number
          or Email Address].
